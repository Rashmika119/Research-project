"""Dataset loading and entity/relation ID mapping for FB15k-237.

Loads the standard FB15k-237 train/valid/test triple files and converts them
into integer-ID triples plus entity2id / relation2id vocabularies built in
train-first order, so IDs are reproducible and independent of how valid/test
happen to be ordered on disk.

FB15k-237 (Freebase-derived) is this project's primary dataset per explicit
supervisor direction — see CLAUDE.md non-negotiable rule #6 for the history
of this decision (WN18RR -> WN18 -> FB15k-237) and why Freebase-style data,
with its much richer per-entity text, is a better fit for testing whether
language-model semantics actually help than WordNet-style data (WN18/WN18RR)
is.

Column order: assumed "head \\t relation \\t tail" (the conventional order
most modern KGE codebases distribute FB15k-237 in) — UNVERIFIED from this
dev machine (no network access here). This is NOT a safe assumption to trust
blindly: WN18's original release turned out to use a different column order
than expected, silently producing a nonsense relation count that still
passed every consistency check. Before trusting this loader's output,
compare `KGDataset.num_relations` against the published FB15k-237 statistics
(14,541 entities / 237 relations / 272,115 train / 17,535 valid / 20,466
test triples) — if the relation count is wildly off, inspect a raw
downloaded line the same way this project did for WN18 and fix
`_read_triples` accordingly.

If the raw FB15k-237 files aren't present and can't be downloaded (no
network, blocked host, etc.), `load_synthetic_toy_graph` produces a small
deterministic fake knowledge graph with the same shape/contract as a real
`KGDataset`, so the rest of the Phase 0 pipeline (ID mapping, adjacency
building, leakage checks) can still be smoke-tested offline. It is not meant
to be trained on for real results — only for exercising the data-handling
code.
