"""Build a training-only message-passing graph from KG triples.

Only `train` triples are ever used to construct edges here — validation and
test triples must never be visible to the graph encoder (see CLAUDE.md
non-negotiable rule #3). `assert_no_leakage` is a cheap sanity check meant to
catch mistakes (e.g. accidentally concatenating splits) before any model
code is written or trained.
